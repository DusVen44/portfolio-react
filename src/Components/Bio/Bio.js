                I am a web developer currently going through Thinkful's Web Developer program. 
                My interest in development stems from a love of making creative ideas
                come to fruition. I enjoy chasing the feeling of satisfaction that's provided when 
                the final product comes together. I'm excited to start working with a team of 
                programmers and learn from the experts in this industry.

                In my free time, I'm usually playing guitar, drums, piano, bass guitar, or the 
                Otamatone (it's like a saxophone mixed with a bagpipe that looks like a Blobfish).
                I can be found in the gym 4-6 days a week, and I have an extreme passion for exotic
                sports cars. I also have an unsuccessful YouTube channel, and I'm proud of my 69 subscribers.
                Check out my portfolio of recent projects, and feel free to contact me.
